  * When there are no people around us, the valves remain open, LED goes green.
  
  * If we are close to any inanimate objects, because the temperature of the object is lower than a human body, the mask will do nothing so you wonâ€™t get a false alarm.
  
  * If someone is getting close within 6 feet, the led on the mask will turn yellow, the valves will be shut, and a warning message will be played to remind people to keep an apporopriate distance.
  
  * If that person is on fever which is the major sympton of the COVID-19, the led will turn red, valves will be shut, and the mask will yell at you to run for your life.

  In order to detect our surroundings at 360 degrees, it probably requires at least 8 sets of smaller sensors working together around us to do so. This is just a testing model of one of the many components. The sensors I used here are way bigger and less accurate. 




* __Overall concept__:

  For my final project, I want to build a social distancing respirator in response to this global pandemic. The respirator will detect the social distance with other people, and monitor people's body temperature.
  
  If the wearer is alone, the LED in front of the respirator will be green and the inhalation valve will remain open. 
  
  If someone get close within 6 feet, the LED will turn yellow and the speaker will play waining to remind people to keep social distance. At the same time, step motors will shut the inhalation valve to protect us from coronavirus.
  
  If someone nearby is having a fever, the LED will turn red, buzzer will go off, valve will shut, sound will play to warn us to run for our life.
