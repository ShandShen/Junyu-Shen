## Week 3
* __Overall concept__:

  For my midterm project, I want to create a robot friend that is able to do two things:
  * Respond to my voice. By using a voice recognition module the led on the robot would change to the color of whatever I command.
  * Respond to my gesture. By using an accelerometer sensor the robot would be able to turn and move to different direction as I move my hand. 

* __Electrical Schematic__:

* __Punch List__:
  * Buy [voice recognition module](https://www.banggood.com/Voice-Recognition-Module-With-Microphone-Control-Voice-Board-p-1056127.html?akmClientCountry=America&utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=liangzhenhua&utm_campaign=MertArduino&utm_content=liangzhenhua&p=CS120478587752016125&cur_warehouse=CN).
  * Buy [accelerometer sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3886).
  * Built led that can respond to the voice.
  * Built motor that can respond to the accelerometer signal.
  * Combine two models.
  * Attach wheels to the motor.
