## Week 3
* _Overall Concept_:
  For my midterm project, I want to create a robot friend that responds to my voice and gesture. I want my robot to be able to do two things:
  * Respond to my voice. By using a voice recognition module the led on the robot will change to the color of whatever I command.
  * Respond to my gesture. By using an accelerometer sensor the robot will be able to turn and move to different directions as I move my hand.
