# Junyu Shen
For CCA 2020 Spring Digital Electronic

## Week 1
My favourite Processing project from last semester.

## Week 2
My favourite Arduino Project: [Arduino Controlled Lightsaber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dzpe1GVOJXU)
Because I've always been a big fan of Star Wars, seeing that I'm able to build a lightsaber with Arduino makes me so excited.

I did a small project using LDR sensor and LED.
