## Week 3
* __Overall Concept__:

  For my midterm project, I want to create a fake turntable record player.

  Two input sensors: 
  
  * Rotatory Encoder to control the volume of speakers. 
  * Rotation Sensor to detects the angle at which the needle is turned.
  
  Two outputs: 
  
  * A motor that spins the vinyl record once the needle is placed on the record. 
  * Speaker that plays music.

* __Punch List__:
  * Must Have: 
    * Two [Rotatory Encoders](https://www.adafruit.com/product/377)
    * Speakers
    * Motor
    * Player Module
  * Nice to Have:
    * Laser cut player case.
    * A screen to show what's playing.
    * A realistic vinyl records.

* __Interested Sensor__:
  * [GPS Module](https://www.adafruit.com/product/790)
  * [Thermal Camera](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3538)
  * [Leap Motion](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2106)

## Week 2
* My favourite Arduino Project: [Arduino Controlled Lightsaber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dzpe1GVOJXU)

  Because I've always been a big fan of Star Wars, seeing that I'm able to build a lightsaber with Arduino makes me so excited.

* I did a small project using LDR sensor and LED.
