# Junyu Shen
For CCA 2020 Spring Digital Electronic

## Week 1
My favourite Processing project from last semester: [Rain Drops](https://github.com/ShandShen/Junyu-Shen/tree/master/Week01)

## Week 2
* My favourite Arduino Project: [Arduino Controlled Lightsaber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dzpe1GVOJXU)

  Because I've always been a big fan of Star Wars, seeing that I'm able to build a lightsaber with Arduino makes me so excited.

* I did a small project using LDR sensor and LED.

## Week 3
* __Overall concept__:

  For my midterm project, I want to create a robot friend that is able to do two things:
  * Respond to my voice. By using a voice recognition module the led on the robot would change to the color of whatever I command.
  * Respond to my gesture. By using an accelerometer sensor the robot would be able to turn and move to different direction as I move my hand. 

* __Electrical Schematic__:

* __Punch List__:
  * Must Have: 
    * [Voice recognition module](https://www.banggood.com/Voice-Recognition-Module-With-Microphone-Control-Voice-Board-p-1056127.html?akmClientCountry=America&utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=liangzhenhua&utm_campaign=MertArduino&utm_content=liangzhenhua&p=CS120478587752016125&cur_warehouse=CN)
    * [Accelerometer sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3886)
    * LEDs
    * Motor
    * Wheels
  * Nice to Have:
    * Speaker so that the robot can talk to me.
    * Screen so that instead of just color changing leds, the robot can make facial expression. 

* __Interested Sensor__:
  * [GPS Module](https://www.adafruit.com/product/790)
  * [Thermal Camera](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3538)
  * [Leap Motion](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2106)
